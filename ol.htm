<p1 style="text-align: justify" >This website is merely about my two favorite albums.
X by Ed Sheeran is a big part of my life. Discovering this album was one of the best things that
has happened to me. There isnt a day that could go by without me listening to this album.</p>
<p2 style="text-align: justify">IYRTITL by Drake is my all time favorite album. I didn't necessarily discover this album
considering the fact that I have always been a fan of him. When he dropped this album
I knew that I would immediatly fall in love with it.</p2>
